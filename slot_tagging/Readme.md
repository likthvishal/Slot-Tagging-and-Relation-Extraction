This repo contains algorithms for the task of Slot Filling. The following algorithms can be implemented:

1. MFT: `MFT.py`
1. Decision Tree with history: `DT_H.py`
1. Decision Tree with history, future and tag: `DT_HFC.py`
1. Encoder Decoder: `EncDec_SL.py`
1. CRF: [https://github.com/threelittlemonkeys/lstm-crf-pytorch]

SGD with logistic regression is implemented in Decision Tree files. Just uncomment the suitable line.

For details about the code, refer to report.pdf
